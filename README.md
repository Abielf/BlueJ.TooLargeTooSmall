# Guessing Game; Too Large Too Small

## **Objective:**
* Write a guessing game which prompts a user to guess a mystery number within a range of 5 to 20.
* After every guess the program should display some variation of "too large", "too small", "correct guess", respectively.
* Upon termination, the program should display the number of guesses before successfully guessing correctly.
* A number that is input consecutively, should register as a single guess.
* put your code in the run() method in class TooLargeTooSmall
* run your code from the Test class.

### **Purpose:**
* To establish familiarity with
    * Control Flow
    * Conditionals
    * User input
    * The `Random` class
    * Object instantation/declaration
    * Method invokation
